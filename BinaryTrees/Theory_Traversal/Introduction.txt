Binary trees are a different data structure and allow hierarchical organisation and structure of multi-level
sequences. This resembles a tree with branching at each node expanding the tree in a non-linear fashion.

BINARY TREE
------------

> A fundamental hierarchical data structure in computer science that comprises nodes arranged in a tree-like structure. It consists
of nodes, where each node can have at mose two children nodes, known as left child and the right child.

> Nodes: Each node in a binary tree contains a piece of data, often referred to as the node's value or key. This node also contains
references and pointers to its left and right children so that we can traverse from one node to another in a hierarchical order.

> Root Node: The topmost node of a binary tree from which all other nodes stem out. This serves as the entry point for traversing the tree structure.

> children Nodes: Nodes directly connected to a parent node. In a binary tree, a parent node can have zero, one, or 
two children nodes, each situated to the left or right of the parent node.

> Leaf Nodes: Nodes that do not have any children. These nodes lie on the outermost ends of the tree branches and are the terminal 
points of the traversal.

> Ancestors: Nodes that lie on the path from a particular node to the root node. There are the nodes encountered while
moving upwards from a specific node through its parent nodes until reaching the root of the tree.

> Full Binary Tree: Also known as strict binary tree, where every node has either zero or two children. No node of this tree has
just a single child, all internal nodes have exactly two children or no children if they are leaf nodes.

    - The property that each node has either 2 or 0 children contributes significantly to the tree's balance., making traversal,
    searching, and insertion options more predictable and efficient. The emphasis on having exactly two children optimises space utilisation
    and makes the tree more balanced.

> Complete Binary Tree: A spcialised form of Binary Tree where all levels are filled completely expect possibly the last level,
which is filled from left to right. All levels of the tree, expect possibly the last one, are fully filled. If the last level
is not completely filled, it is filled from left to right, ensuring that nodes are positioned as far left as possible.

    - In a complete binary tree, all leaf nodes are in the last level or the second-to-last level and they are positioned towards the leftmost side.
    - This structure is particularly useful for storing data in structures like heaps, where efficient access to the top elements(root) or certain properities
    (e.g., maximum or minimum values in a heap) is crucial. The completeness property aids in achieving balanced structures, making 
    it easier to implement algorithms and ensuring reasonably consistent performance.
    - Although it might seem similar to a full binary tree, a complete binary tree doesn't require all nodes to have two children, 
    it's about the positioning and arrangement of nodes.

> Perfect Binary Tree: A type of binary tree where all leaf nodes are at the same level and the number of leaf nodes is maximised
for that level. Every node in a perfect binary tree has either zero or two children. This means that every internal node(non-leaf node)
has exactly tow children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

    - All levels of this tree are fully filled with nodes including the last level. Perfect Binary Trees have a balanced structure
    that maximises the number of nodes for a given height, creating a dense structure where the number of nodes doubles as we move down each level of the tree.
    - Properities of perfect binary trees make them efficient for certain operations like searching and sorting dure to their balanced nature.
    However, achieving and maintaining perfect balance, especially when the number of nodes is not a power of two, might not be feasible in many
    practical applications.

> Balanced Binary Tree: A type of binary tree where the heights of the two subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This
property ensures that the tree remains relatively well-balanced, preventing the tree from becoming highly skewed or degenerate.

    - Heights of two subtree of any node differ by atmost one.
    - In a balanced binary tree, the height of the tree should be log2N at maximum, where N is the number of nodes. This ensures
    that the tree does not become heavily skewed or imbalanced. The distribution of nodes of both the left and right subtrees remains
    relatively even throughout the tree.

> Degenerate Tree: A Binary Tree where the nodes are arranged in a single path leaning to the right or left. The tree resembles a linked list
in its structure where each node points to the next node in a linear fashion.

    - Each level of this tree only has one node. The height of the tree reaches 'n', i.e., the number of nodes in the tree, resulting in
    inefficient search operations. Though degenerate trees are not commonly used intentionally due to their inefficient nature for
    most operations, they may occur inadvertently in scenarios where nodes are inserted in a specific order(e.g., always to the right or left),
    causing the tree to lose its balanced properities.
    - Understanding degenerate trees is essential in analysing the worst-case time complexity of algorithms in scenarios where the
    tree structure degrades to this linear form, as it can help in optimising algorithms for these situations.
